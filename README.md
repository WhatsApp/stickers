# WhatsApp Stickers

If you'd like to create your own stickers for WhatsApp, you can package them in an Android or iOS app. You can publish your sticker app like any other app to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, and users who download and install your app will be able to start sending those stickers right away from within WhatsApp. Stickers on WhatsApp must be legal, authorized and acceptable. Learn more about acceptable uses of our services from our [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#terms-of-service).

To get started, review the README files in the [android](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers/tree/master/android) or [iOS](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers/tree/master/iOS) folders, and refer to the FAQ at https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/26000226.
